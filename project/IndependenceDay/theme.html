        <p>Investing in child development is the key to building a better future for any nation. The values, education
            and
            health of children directly influence the social and economic indicators of countries and also shape its
            global
            standing. Hence, it is vital that children have access to civic, social and moral education; health care
            services and exposure to the latest developments across fields (scientific, technological, cultural, arts,
            educational etc.). While there have been significant improvements in childcare in India, there remains work
            to
            be done in many areas including health services, sanitation, education, especially for children in rural and
            tribal communities.</p>

        <p>The healthcare sector comprises of hospitals, medical devices, clinical trials, outsourcing, telemedicine,

            Historically traditional approaches to health based on our profound knowledge of ancient systems of medicine
            anchored in Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy. Unani, Siddha, and Homoeopathy have also been an important part
            of the health and wellness narrative in India.

            giving a kick start to the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan (self-reliant India campaign) and announced the

            the panch prans that were mentioned by the Prime Minister on 76th Independence Day 2022. With these common
            goals in mind, we shall move forward together as more unified union, towards the coveted 100 years of

        <p>On the occasion of the UN Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC COP26), Hon’ble Prime Minister Narendra Modi
            introduced the mission of “LiFE (Lifestyle for the Environment)” to engage individuals in mitigating the
            adverse effects of climate change.
            <br>
            This initiative encourages a lifestyle that focuses on mindful and deliberate utilization of resources and
            aims to change the present 'use and dispose of' consumption habits. The idea behind is to encourage
            individuals to adopt simple changes in their daily life that can contribute to climate change.
