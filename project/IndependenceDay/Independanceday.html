                    independence:</a></p><br>
            <p>“The Indian Independence Bill, which carves the independent nations of India and Pakistan out of the
                former
                Mogul
                Empire, comes into force at the stroke of midnight on August 15, 1947. The long-awaited agreement ended
                200
                years of British rule and was hailed by Indian independence leader Mohandas Gandhi as the ‘noblest act
                of
                the
                British nation.”</p><br>
            <p>“By the 19th century, Great Britain had become the dominant political power on the subcontinent and India
                was
                seen as the "Jewel in the Crown" of the British Empire. The British Indian Army played a vital role in
                both
                World Wars. Years of nonviolent resistance to British rule, led by Mohandas GANDHI and Jawaharlal NEHRU,
                eventually resulted in Indian independence in 1947. Large-scale communal violence took place before and
                after
                the subcontinent partition into two separate states - India and Pakistan. The neighboring countries have
                fought
                three wars since independence, the last of which was in 1971 and resulted in East Pakistan becoming the
                separate
                nation of Bangladesh.”</p><br>

            <p>In 1757, the East India Company defeated the last Nawab of Bengal in the Battle of Plassey, which marked
                the beginning of British rule in India. The Indian Rebellion or the First War of Independence took place
                in 1857 which was a major yet unsuccessful uprising against British rule.</p><br>
            <p>In the year 1885, India’s first political party, Indian National Congress was formed. And after the
                conclusion of World War I in 1918, Indian activists called for self-rule or ‘Swaraj’.In 1929, the Indian
                National Congress declared ‘Purna Swaraj’ or the Independence of India at an assembly in Lahore.
                Finally, after a series of sessions and meetings between the British government and the Indian National
                Congress, Lord Mountbatten who served as the last viceroy of pre-independent India, agreed to the
                proposal.On 15th August 1947, Lord Mountbatten partitioned British India into two new independent
                nations; India and Pakistan. This marked the first India Independence Day 1947.</p><br>
