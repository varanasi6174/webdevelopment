    <h2>About Varanasi</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Often described as a city as old as time itself, Varanasi is India’s most ancient city. Considered to be one of
        the
        oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, Varanasi is also known as Kashi and Benares. Down the ages it
        has
        played a pivotal role in Indian history and culture and has been the cradle of the country’s philosophy and
        music.

        Hindus consider Varanasi, on the banks of the Ganga, as their holiest city. It gets its name from the rivers
        Varuna
        and Asi, tributaries that flow in to the Ganga in Varanasi. Also known as the ‘City of Light', legend has it
        that
        the city was founded by Lord Shiva himself. Devout Hindus consider frequent pilgrimages to Varanasi essential to
        attaining liberation or moksh and breathing their last in the city as tantamount to achieving it. The Buddha
        gave
        his first sermon, after attaining enlightenment, at Sarnath, close to the city.</p><br>

    <p>Varanasi has often been at the crossroads of history. The ancient road from Taxila to Pataliputra, connecting
        western
        and eastern India, passed through the city. Sher Shah Suri’s road connecting Peshawar to Kolkata also passed
        through
        it. Its fame also attracted numerous conquerors and invaders who despoiled it but never could extinguish the
        city’s
        spirit. So, it rose once again and continued to flourish.

        Over the centuries, the city has been home to numerous philosophers, musicians, artists and poets including
        Tulsidas, Kabir, Munshi Premchand and Ustad Bismillah Khan who have left their imprint on the country at large.
        Famous shrines, historical monuments and institutions dot the city’s landscape giving visitors a glimpse into
        Varanasi’s hoary past.

    <p>
        Varanasi, or Benaras, (also known as Kashi) is one of the oldest living cities in the world. Varanasi`s
        Prominence
        in Hindu mythology is virtually unrevealed. Mark Twain, the English author and literature, who was enthralled by
        the
        legend and sanctity of Benaras, once wrote :
        “Benaras is older than history, older than tradition, older even than legend and looks twice as old as all of
        them
        put together”.

        The land of Varanasi (Kashi) has been the ultimate pilgrimage spot for Hindus for ages. Hindus believe that one
        who
        is graced to die on the land of Varanasi would attain salvation and freedom from the cycle of birth and
        re-birth.
        Abode of Lord Shiva and Parvati, the origins of Varanasi are yet unknown. Ganges in Varanasi is believed to have
        the
        power to wash away the sins of mortals. Hindus believe that one who is graced to die on the land of Varanasi
