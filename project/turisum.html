    <h2>Tulsi Manas Mandir</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Tulsi Manas Mandir (Hindi: तुलसी मानस मंदिर) is one of the most famous temples in the holy city of Varanasi. This
        temple has great historical and cultural importance in Hinduism since the ancient Hindu epic Ramcharitmanas was
        originally written at this place by Hindu poet-saint, reformer and philosopher Goswami Tulsidas in the 16th
        century. </p>
    <br>
    <p>One of the famous Hindu epics, Ramayan was originally written in Sanskrit language by Sanskrit poet Valmiki
        between 500 and 100 BC. Being in Sanskrit language, this epic was not accessible to and understood by masses. In
        the 16th century, Goswami Tulsidas wrote the Ramayan in Awadhi dialect of Hindi language and the Awadhi version
        was called Ramcharitmanas (meaning Lake of the deeds of Rama).

        In 1964, the Sureka family constructed a temple at the same place where Goswami Tulsidas wrote Ramcharitmanas.
